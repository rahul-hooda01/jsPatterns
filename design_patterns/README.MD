### **‚úçWhat Are Design Patterns and Why Do We Use Them?**

**Design patterns** are tried-and-tested solutions to common problems in software design. They are not specific pieces of code but general templates or best practices that can be adapted to suit different situations. Design patterns help in designing flexible and reusable code by providing solutions that have been proven to work in similar scenarios.

Design patterns are typically divided into three main categories:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation.
2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition and the relationships between them.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with how objects interact and communicate.

Each design pattern has:

- **A problem it addresses**: A specific issue or scenario commonly encountered in software development.
- **A solution**: A general approach or template that solves the problem.
- **Consequences**: The trade-offs or impacts of using the pattern in terms of flexibility, complexity, and performance.

### Why Do We Use Design Patterns?

- Provide **proven solutions** to common software design problems.
- Improve **code reusability**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**.
- Encourage **best practices** for structuring and organizing code.
- Facilitate **efficient communication** with a shared vocabulary.
- Enable **flexibility** and adaptability to future changes.
- Help **avoid reinventing the wheel**, saving time and effort.
- Lead to **better quality software** that's easier to manage and extend.

### Summary:

- **Design patterns** are general solutions to recurring problems in software design.
- They improve code **reusability**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**.
- Patterns help developers **communicate** effectively, and allow for more **flexible** and **modular** code.
- Using patterns means **adopting best practices** that have been proven to solve common problems efficiently, making software systems more robust and easier to manage.

In summary, the patterns are grouped as:

- **Creational**:
    - Singleton Pattern
    - Factory Pattern
    - Abstract Factory Pattern
- **Structural**:
    - Proxy Pattern
    - Facade Pattern
    - Decorator Pattern
    - Revealing Module Pattern
    - Mix-ins
- **Behavioral**:
    - Observer Pattern
    - Strategy Pattern
