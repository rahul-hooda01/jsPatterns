## **Observer Pattern**

The **Observer Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, such that when one object (the **subject**) changes state, all its dependent objects (the **observers**) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used to implement distributed event-handling systems.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Subject**: The object whose state changes and needs to notify its dependents.
2. **Observers**: Objects that need to be notified when the subject's state changes.
3. **Decoupling**: The subject and observers are loosely coupled, meaning the subject does not need to know the specifics of the observers or vice versa.

### Purpose:

- To **facilitate communication** between objects in a way that allows for flexible and dynamic updates.
- To promote **loose coupling** between components, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.
- To implement **event-handling systems** where changes in one part of the system are reflected in other parts automatically.

### How It Works:

1. **Define Subject Interface**: The subject maintains a list of observers and provides methods to attach, detach, and notify them.
2. **Define Observer Interface**: The observer interface defines a method for updating the observer when the subjectâ€™s state changes.
3. **Concrete Subject**: Implements the subject interface and manages the state, notifying observers of changes.
4. **Concrete Observer**: Implements the observer interface and updates itself based on notifications from the subject.

### Benefits:

1. **Loose Coupling**: Promotes loose coupling between the subject and observers, improving flexibility and maintainability.
2. **Dynamic Updates**: Observers are updated automatically when the subject's state changes, without needing to manually check for changes.
3. **Scalability**: Easily add or remove observers without affecting the subject or other observers.

### Drawbacks:

1. **Performance Overhead**: The notification process may introduce performance overhead if there are many observers or frequent updates.
2. **Complexity**: Can add complexity to the system, especially with multiple subjects and observers interacting.

### Summary:

- The **Observer Pattern** allows an object (subject) to notify multiple dependent objects (observers) of state changes.
- It promotes loose coupling, making systems more modular and easier to maintain.
- The pattern is useful for implementing event-handling systems but can introduce performance overhead and complexity if not managed carefully.
