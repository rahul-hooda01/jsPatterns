### **Abstract Factory Pattern**:

- **Purpose**: The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Focus**: It focuses on creating entire families or groups of objects that belong to the same theme or concept (e.g., different types of products like UI elements, databases, etc.).
- **Implementation**: You define an abstract factory that creates a set of related objects, and concrete factories implement this interface to provide specific implementations.
- **Usage**: Use Abstract Factory when you need to create groups or families of related objects (e.g., creating UI components like buttons, text boxes, etc., with a specific theme like Windows or MacOS).
    
    ### Key Differences:
    
    1. **Level of Abstraction**:
        - **Factory Pattern** focuses on creating one type of object, allowing subclasses to determine the actual implementation.
        - **Abstract Factory** focuses on creating groups of related objects, enforcing consistency within families of objects.
    2. **Scope**:
        - **Factory Pattern** deals with one product or object at a time.
        - **Abstract Factory** deals with a family of products, ensuring consistency among the products.
    3. **Complexity**:
        - **Factory Pattern** is simpler, as it revolves around a single method or factory to create objects.
        - **Abstract Factory** is more complex, as it involves multiple factories and products, making it more scalable for complex systems.
