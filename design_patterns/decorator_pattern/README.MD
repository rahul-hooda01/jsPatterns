**Common Creational Patterns**

- **Decorator Pattern:**

> The **Decorator Design Pattern** is a structural pattern that allows you to dynamically add behaviors or responsibilities to an object without altering its structure. It's useful for extending the functionality of objects in a flexible and reusable way.
> 

**Examples:**

**Extending Third-Party Libraries:** When you want to extend functionality in third-party libraries without modifying their code.

**Middleware in express.js:**

> in the context of **Express.js**, middleware can be seen as a practical implementation of the **Decorator Design Pattern**. Middleware functions act as decorators by adding additional behavior (like logging, authentication, etc.) to the route handlers without altering their core logic.
