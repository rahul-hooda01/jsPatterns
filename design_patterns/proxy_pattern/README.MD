### **Proxy Pattern:**
## Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### **Types of Proxies**:

- **Virtual Proxy:** Manages expensive object creation and initialization on demand.
- **Remote Proxy:** Controls access to an object that is in a different address space.
- **Protection Proxy:** Manages access control for sensitive objects.
- **Caching Proxy:** Stores results of expensive operations and returns cached results when the same requests are made.

### **Applications of the Proxy Design Pattern:**

- **Security:** Restricting access to sensitive operations or data (e.g., protection proxy for user roles).
- **Lazy Initialization:** Deferring the creation of expensive objects until they are actually needed (e.g., virtual proxy for resource-heavy operations).
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Tracking method calls or object interactions in real-time.
- **Caching Results:** Storing the results of expensive operations and serving cached results when the same operation is requested again.
- **Remote Object Management:** Handling objects in different address spaces or over networks (remote proxy).

> The proxy pattern is particularly useful in cases where you need fine-grained control over access to resources,
> such as in API gateways, network operations, or security-sensitive applications.
