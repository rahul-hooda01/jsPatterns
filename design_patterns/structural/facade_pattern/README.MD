## **Decorator Pattern**

The **Decorator Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Dynamic Behavior Addition**: It enables adding new functionality to objects at runtime, without modifying their structure.
2. **Component Interface**: The pattern works by using a base interface or abstract class, ensuring that the decorators and the objects they decorate conform to the same interface.
3. **Chaining**: Multiple decorators can be combined to extend the functionality of an object in a layered manner.

### Purpose:

- To **add functionality** to objects without modifying their code.
- To provide a **flexible way** to extend functionality, which can be achieved dynamically and independently.
- To **avoid class proliferation** that occurs with subclassing to extend behavior.

### Benefits:

1. **Flexible Functionality**: Allows dynamic and flexible addition of responsibilities to objects.
2. **Avoids Subclass Explosion**: Reduces the need for creating many subclasses to extend behavior, leading to a more manageable codebase.
3. **Combining Behaviors**: Multiple decorators can be combined to create a variety of object configurations.

### Drawbacks:

1. **Complexity**: Can introduce complexity due to the number of classes and objects, making it harder to understand the overall system.
2. **Overhead**: May introduce performance overhead due to the increased number of objects and method calls.

### Summary:

- The **Decorator Pattern** allows dynamic addition of behavior to objects without modifying their code.
- It uses a base interface or class and allows wrapping objects with additional functionality through decorators.
- It offers flexibility and avoids class proliferation, but can introduce complexity and performance overhead.
