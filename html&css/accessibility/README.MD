**What is Accessibility?**

Web accessibility refers to designing and developing websites so that everyone, including people with disabilities, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web. This ensures that the web is inclusive for users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Semantic HTML**: Using proper HTML tags for their intended purpose (e.g., using `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, etc.).
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: Attributes that enhance the accessibility of dynamic content.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring that all elements can be accessed using a keyboard (without a mouse).
- **Screen Readers**: Assistive technologies that read out content for users who are visually impaired.
- **Color Contrast**: Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background to improve readability for all users.
- **Alternative Text (alt text)**: Descriptions for images and media for users relying on screen readers.

**Accessibility Best Practices:**

- Use semantic HTML wherever possible (e.g., `<button>`, `<form>`, `<input>`).
- Provide alternative text for images and non-text content.
- Ensure good color contrast for readability.
- Make sure all interactive elements (like buttons and links) are keyboard accessible.
- Use ARIA attributes sparingly to enhance accessibility without overloading the markup.
