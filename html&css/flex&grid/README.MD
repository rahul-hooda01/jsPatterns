### **CSS Flexbox**

**What is Flexbox?**

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout model in CSS designed to arrange items efficiently inside a container. It's best for creating layouts where elements need to align, distribute space, and respond to varying screen sizes.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Main axis**: The direction along which the flex items are placed (horizontal by default).
- **Cross axis**: The perpendicular direction to the main axis.
- **Flex container**: The parent element that contains flex items.
- **Flex items**: The child elements inside the flex container.

**Common Flexbox Properties:**

- `display: flex`: Defines a flex container.
- `justify-content`: Aligns items along the main axis (e.g., left, right, center).
- `align-items`: Aligns items along the cross axis (e.g., top, center, bottom).
- `flex-direction`: Defines the main axis direction (row or column).
- `flex-wrap`: Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines.

### **CSS Grid**

**What is CSS Grid?**

CSS Grid is a powerful 2D layout system for building web designs. It allows you to define both rows and columns, making it suitable for creating complex web layouts with ease.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Grid container**: The parent element with `display: grid`.
- **Grid items**: The child elements inside the grid container.
- **Grid tracks**: Rows and columns formed by grid lines.
- **Grid areas**: Named sections of the grid for easier placement.

**Common Grid Properties:**

- `display: grid`: Defines a grid container.
- `grid-template-columns`: Defines the number and size of columns.
- `grid-template-rows`: Defines the number and size of rows.
- `grid-gap`: Adds spacing between grid items.
- `grid-area`: Assigns an item to a specific area in the grid.

Both Flexbox and Grid have their strengths:

- **Flexbox** is best for one-dimensional layouts (row or column).
- **Grid** is more suitable for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns).
