### **Modal Dialog: Creating Accessible Modal Dialogs**

**What is a Modal Dialog?**

A modal dialog is a window that appears on top of the main content, requiring the user to interact with it before returning to the main interface. It's commonly used for alerts, confirmations, forms, and other interactions that demand immediate attention.

**Accessibility Considerations:**

- **Focus Management**: When the modal opens, focus should move to the modal. When it closes, focus should return to the triggering element.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Users should be able to navigate within the modal using the keyboard (e.g., Tab key).
- **Screen Readers**: Use ARIA roles and attributes to inform assistive technologies about the modal's purpose and state.
- **Background Content**: Prevent interaction with background content when the modal is open.

**Best Practices:**

- **Use Semantic HTML**: Utilize native elements like `<button>` for built-in accessibility features.
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with screen readers to ensure all users can interact with the modal effectively.
- **Focus Trapping**: Ensure that keyboard focus doesn't escape the modal when it's open.
