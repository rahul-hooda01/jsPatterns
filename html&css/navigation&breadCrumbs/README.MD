### **Navigation in HTML/CSS**

**What is Navigation?**

Navigation refers to the way users move through different sections of a website. Good navigation ensures that users can easily find the content they're looking for and is critical for user experience and accessibility.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Navigation Bar (NavBar)**: A menu (often at the top or side) that links to different sections of a website.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using the `<nav>` element to define the navigation region, which helps screen readers and search engines.
- **Responsive Navigation**: Adapting navigation for different devices (e.g., dropdowns for mobile).
- **Breadcrumbs**: A secondary navigation aid that shows the user's location in a website hierarchy.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Used to provide additional context for screen readers.

### **Best Practices for Accessible Navigation**:

1. **Use semantic HTML** (`<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.) for better accessibility.
2. **ARIA attributes** can provide context (e.g., `aria-label`) for screen readers.
3. **Keyboard navigation** should be fully supported; ensure that users can navigate through all interactive elements using only the keyboard.
4. **Responsive design** is essential. Make sure the navigation adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
5. **Focus states**: Make sure interactive elements (links, buttons) have visible focus indicators when navigated with the keyboard.
