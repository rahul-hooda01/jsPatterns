### DOM (Document Object Model):

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface provided by browsers to represent and interact with web documents (HTML, XML). The DOM represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document (e.g., elements, attributes, text). It allows JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages in response to user interactions or other events.

In other words, the DOM acts as a bridge between HTML and JavaScript, enabling developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications.

### Core Concepts:

1. **DOM Tree**: The structure of the HTML document is represented as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to a part of the document (like elements, text, comments, etc.).
2. **Elements and Nodes**: Each tag in HTML is represented as an element node, and text between tags is represented as a text node.
3. **DOM Manipulation**: Using JavaScript, you can add, remove, or modify elements in the DOM to change the content or layout dynamically.

### Key DOM Methods:

- **`document.getElementById()`**: Selects an element by its `id`.
- **`document.querySelector()` / `document.querySelectorAll()`**: Select elements using CSS selectors.
- **`element.innerHTML` / `element.textContent`**: Get or set the HTML or text content of an element.
- **`element.setAttribute()`**: Set an attribute on an element.
- **`element.classList.add()` / `element.classList.remove()`**: Add or remove a CSS class from an element.
- **`element.appendChild()`**: Add a new child element to an existing element.




### Summary of DOM Manipulation:

- **DOM** represents a web page as a tree of nodes, which can be manipulated using JavaScript.
- Common operations include adding/removing elements, modifying attributes, and handling events.
- DOM manipulation allows you to create interactive and dynamic web applications by responding to user actions and external data in real time.
