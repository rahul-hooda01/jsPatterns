### ***Functions and Scope:***

- **Functions**: A reusable block of code that can be called to perform a task.
    - You define a function using the `function` keyword, give it a name, and then call it when needed.
    - Functions can take **parameters** (inputs) and return a value using the `return` statement.
- **Scope**: Determines the visibility of variables.
    - **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside any function or block can be accessed anywhere.
    - **Local Scope (Function Scope)**: Variables defined inside a function are only accessible within that function.
    - **Block Scope** (using `let` or `const`): Variables are confined to the block (like an `if` statement or loop) where they are declared.

Here are some key points:

- Functions can help you avoid repeating code.
- Scope controls where variables can be used and prevents name collisions.
